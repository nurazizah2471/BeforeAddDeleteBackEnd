        "description": "Pandawa Beach is a white sandy beach with a length of approximately 1 km which is flanked by two pieces small cape on the left and right as a barrier. This beach forms a crescent moon when seen from the air with a width of approximately 250 meters if it is drawn a line from the shoreline to the land. Part of this coastal plain bounded by hills was very steep and precipitous that was previously inaccessible. That is why the prime tourists who find this beach called it a 'hidden beach'. At that time said to be 'hidden' because it has no access to the beaches. It is said that some of the tourists who want to enjoy the beaches like sunbathing, bathing etc must use ropes to reach its shores. Since that time the beach is known and spread to fellow tourists as 'hidden beach'. Although now it can no longer be referred to as a hidden beach but the title was still stuck because of the history of the term discovery. That is cursory the term of 'hidden beach'.",
